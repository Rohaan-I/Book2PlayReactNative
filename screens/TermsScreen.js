8. BOOKING CONDITIONS
Our Site and Application helps you to find sports activities and locations and to make reservations for these either through links to third parties or through this Site and Application for services and products delivered by suppliers for whom We act as agents. When you make a booking, you are entering into a contract with suppliers via Book2Play, not with Book2Play itself.
As such when making a booking for a sports Facility it is your responsibility to seek out and familiarise out the terms for that sports Facility in the instance that they are not otherwise provided to you.
As the Site and Application acts as an interface in your transactions with suppliers in the sport industry, you must be legally authorised to enter into contractual obligations and have the requisite consent or authority to act for or on behalf of any persons included in such transactions. If you are under the age of 18, you must not Use this Site or Application or submit personal information unless you have the consent of, and are supervised by, a parent or guardian. You warrant that all data provided by you is accurate and you guarantee the accuracy of any information entered on this Site or Application by you in relation to a transaction, booking or person whom you represent.
Any Use of this Site or Application by you which is fraudulent or in conflict with these Site Terms shall give Us the right to refuse you access to the products and services offered by Us and sport industry suppliers or to the Site or Application.
Any bookings made by you with third party suppliers (who are not Affiliates) will be governed by the terms and conditions of such third party suppliers. Any bookings made by you through this Site or Application with Affiliates will be governed by these Site Terms and any other legal notices contained on this Site or Application or any other specific sales terms and conditions which are on this Site or Application and which We draw your attention to during the booking process.
9. LIABILITY FOR BOOKINGS
Book2Play is not responsible for and disclaims any and all liability related to any and all bookings for our suppliers’ Facilities. Accordingly, any bookings that are made by you as a result of using the site are done so at your own risk and when making a booking you accept all liability for any losses or damages that occur at a Facility as a direct or indirect result of a booking you make for the Facility.
Book2Play shall not in any circumstances have any liability for any losses or damages which may be suffered by the supplier (or any person claiming under or through the supplier), whether the same are suffered directly or indirectly or are immediate or consequential, and whether the same arise in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise howsoever, which fall within any of the following categories:
damage, even though Book2Play was aware of the circumstances in which such special damages could arise;
loss of profits;
loss of anticipated savings;
loss of business opportunity;
loss of goodwill;
any injury or death resulting from a booking that MLP facilitated.
10. PRICING, CHANGES TO BOOKINGS AND CANCELLATIONS
All refunds and cancellations are subject to the Facility’s terms. In general, there are no refunds granted for the cancellation of bookings. A change in time, partial refund or refund may be granted at the absolute discretion of Book2Play and/or the Facility.
There may be unforeseen changes to the availability of a slot after a booking has been paid for via the site. In these cases We will do all that is reasonably possible to find an alternative slot, and if none can be found that you would like to accept, a full refund will be processed with 2 business days.
The Facility may cancel or move a booking at any time for reasons beyond Our control. In these instances we will make every effort to gain a refund on behalf of the booker or move the booking to a suitable time.
The price for bookings may change at any time and the information provided on our site may not be correct. Facilities will make every effort to ensure that the correct pricing is provided at the time of booking. As such it is the Facility’s responsibility to update the price difference and we accept no liability for any change in price.
As an Agent We reserve the right to charge a non-refundable booking fee to cover our expenses, including (but not limited to) card handling fees.
